I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Stanford University. Prior to joining Stanford, I have worked at NAVER AI and KAIST, advised by Jinkyoo Park. I hold a Master's degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering from KAIST and a double Bachelor's in Control Theory and Automation Engineering from the University of Bologna and Tongji University.

My work spans topics in deep learning, dynamical systems, variational inference and numerical methods. I am broadly interested in extending the successes achieved by deep learning methods in computer vision and natural language to other engineering domains. 

To achieve this vision, I believe in two fundamental ingredients: 

(1) High-quality ML software standards common in computer vision and natural language (including training heuristics and highly parallelizable routines) should be exported and adapted to other engineering domains.

(2) Domain expertise should be embedded in the learning model whenever possible and should guide every other design decision. This includes (partial) mathematical models and numerical methods. 

I am a core maintainer and contributor to various open-source libraries for neural differential equations and numerical methods for neural networks.
